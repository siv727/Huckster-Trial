# Retail Inventory App - Final Project

## Project Description
Huckster is a **Retail Inventory App** developed as the final project for our **Mobile Development** course. The app aims to help small businesses, such as sari-sari stores, manage their inventory efficiently with a user-friendly interface and essential features such as stock tracking, sales monitoring, and reporting.

## Labs Branch
The `labs` branch serves as a development environment where all code changes made during laboratory exercises are pushed before merging into the `main` branch. This ensures that all experimental features and updates are properly reviewed and tested before being deployed to the main codebase.

### Guidelines for Labs Branch:
1. **All new features and bug fixes must first be committed to the `labs` branch.**
2. Regular testing should be conducted before merging into `main`.
3. Code reviews are required before any pull request to the `main` branch.
4. Developers should document any major changes in the project to maintain clarity.

## Backup Branch - WARNING

## ⚠️ DO NOT TAMPER WITH THE BACKUP BRANCH ⚠️

### Important Guidelines:
1. **Do NOT modify, delete, or override files in the backup branch unless absolutely necessary.**
2. The backup branch should only be updated when everything in the `main` branch is confirmed to be working properly.
3. Before updating the backup, perform thorough testing to ensure no broken or unstable code is pushed.
4. If you need to update the backup, make sure you document the changes clearly.
5. Any unauthorized changes to this branch may cause data loss or rollback issues.

### How to Update the Backup:
1. Verify that the `main` branch is stable and has passed all necessary tests.
2. Merge the `main` branch into the backup branch following the correct versioning and documentation standards.
3. Double-check the integrity of the backup after merging.
4. Inform the team about the update to prevent conflicts.

**Failure to follow these guidelines may result in critical system failures. Please handle with caution.**
